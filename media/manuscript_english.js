    Gingivitis and caries attack usually start from there. That is why it is recommended that you use dental \
    floss at least once a day before you brush your teeth. Take a long enough string of dental floss and spin it \
    around your fingers. Let the dental floss carefully follow the outline of your tooth and down into the gum. \
    Pull the dental floss carefully up again and down on the other side of your tooth. Repeat this stage for each tooth, even the ones in the back."
